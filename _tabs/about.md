This is [Yubo Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yubo-wang-057616117/), a software engineer focused on AI infrastructure. Currently, I lead the development of LinkedIn's AI Training Platform, where my team leveraged Flyte to support diverse training workloads including RecSys models and LLMs. I'm currently on my journey to learn more about LLM infrastructure.

I have a 7 year old cat named 鼻妞. She kneads really good dough.
